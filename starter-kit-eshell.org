The =eshell= directory holds alias definitions and history
information.  It is much like a =.bashrc= file for those who are
familiar with bash.  This set the value of =eshell-directory-name= to
point to the =eshell= directory in this directory.  The =alias= file
is pre-populated with some generally applicable aliases.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq eshell-directory-name
        (expand-file-name "./" (expand-file-name "eshell" starter-kit-dir)))
